# Personal Project: Fill-Me-Up!
Hello! This project is dedicated to people who have to memorize a long text or simply a material for an exam. By changing missing letters in a sentence and seeing the evaluation after, I believe it will be easier for people to remember their mistakes.


## Project Description
The User Interface were not the main point of this project.

I provided a template text for testing, but the user are able to input their texts manually using a provided textbox. The difficulties and algorithms are created using various functions in their own seperate javascript files in _src/functions_. _Regular Expression_ or known as _regex_ are used to filter the texts from spaces, punctuations, and line breaks. Difficulties are adjusted using parameters, in which determine how many gaps are generated in a sentence.

Then the score are shown in percentage as an evaluation of the quiz.
## Result
The web-app are available and could be accessed in https://fill-me-up.netlify.app/.

## Improvement
Most important of all, the UI could be improved significantly.

That aside, if this will be implemented as a challenge or a game, a scoreboard system could be implemented. 

I haven't also added a support for text in foreign languages that has a lot of special letters (such as Umlaut in German). By adjusting the _regex_, support to these said languages could be implemented.

I do also think that the layout could be written in a more efficient way.
## Afterword
Hopefully this project might be helpful for those who have trouble in memorization. Thank you for reading!
